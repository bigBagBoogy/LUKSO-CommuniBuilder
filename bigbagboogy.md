# Creating a Tokenized Community Template (Wizard):

Feasibility: Developing a template or wizard for creating Tokenized Communities can be a more manageable project in terms of scope. It simplifies the process of setting up new communities by providing pre-configured templates with customizable options.

Innovation: The innovation here lies in simplifying the creation of Tokenized Communities. You'd need to design the template in a way that makes it easy for users to set up their communities with unique features, tokens, and governance models.

Value: While this option might not have the same immediate impact as a fully functional community, it can be highly valuable in the long run. It empowers other developers and community builders to quickly set up their tokenized communities, potentially leading to a broader adoption of LUKSO.
