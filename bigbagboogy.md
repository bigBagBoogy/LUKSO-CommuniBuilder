# token economics

Content Curation Rewards: Reward community members with tokens for curating high-quality content. This incentivizes users to contribute valuable content and participate actively in the community.

Moderator Rewards: Recognize and reward community moderators who help maintain a positive and constructive environment. This can include features like reporting inappropriate content.

Content Creation Bounties: Allow community creators to propose and fund bounties for specific content or projects within the community. Other members can then contribute tokens to these bounties, encouraging content creation.

Staking and Delegated Voting: Implement staking mechanisms that allow users to lock up their tokens for voting power. Users can also delegate their voting power to trusted community members, fostering a more democratic decision-making process.

Treasury and Governance Proposals: Create a community treasury where a portion of the tokens is stored. Users can submit governance proposals, and the community votes on how to allocate these funds.

NFT Integration: Consider integrating NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) into the community. These NFTs can represent rare or exclusive items, access, or memberships within the community.

Resource Allocation: Allow community members to allocate tokens for resource-sharing purposes, such as bandwidth, storage, or computational resources.

Community Challenges and Competitions: Host challenges or competitions within the community that reward participants with tokens for their achievements. This can encourage skill development and engagement.

Marketplace for Digital Goods: Create a marketplace within the community where users can buy and sell digital goods using tokens. This can include art, collectibles, or other virtual items.

Membership Tiers: Implement tiered membership levels, where users can unlock additional features, privileges, or content as they accumulate more tokens or engage more actively in the community.

Liquidity and Trading: Enable users to trade community tokens on decentralized exchanges, creating a market for the tokens. This can also involve liquidity pools for token swaps.

Referral and Affiliate Programs: Encourage users to refer new members to the community by rewarding them with tokens for successful referrals.

Community Challenges: Organize challenges or competitions within the community, where users can compete and earn tokens for their performance.

# sensorship-resistance implications! how to handle?

Handling censorship resistance in a highly decentralized environment, such as the LUKSO blockchain, is a complex but essential consideration for your tokenized community template. While censorship resistance is valuable for preserving free speech and open discussions, it's important to strike a balance and consider the following approaches:

1. **Moderation and Community Guidelines:** Implement a moderation system and clear community guidelines. While censorship should be minimized, there may be cases where it's necessary to remove harmful or inappropriate content. Make these guidelines transparent and involve the community in their creation and enforcement.

2. **User Reputation and Trust Metrics:** Develop reputation systems that allow the community to identify trusted members. Users with higher reputation may have more influence in content promotion and moderation decisions.

3. **Community Governance:** Allow the community to have a say in content moderation and censorship policies through a decentralized governance model. Users can collectively decide on what constitutes censorship-worthy behavior.

4. **Immutable Content vs. Mutable Metadata:** Distinguish between the immutability of content and the mutability of metadata. Content (text, images, videos) could be stored in an immutable way on the blockchain, while metadata (titles, tags, or descriptions) can be mutable, allowing users to edit or remove context.

5. **Data Availability:** Ensure that content remains available and retrievable even if it's removed from the primary user interface. This involves archiving and distributing content across multiple decentralized nodes.

6. **Off-Chain Storage and Processing:** Consider storing some content off-chain to reduce the impact of storing large volumes of data on the blockchain. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or similar technologies can be used for this purpose.

7. **Data Privacy and Encryption:** Implement encryption and privacy features that allow users to have control over their data. Users can choose to share content privately or publicly.

8. **Whitelists and Blacklists:** Allow users to create and manage whitelists (for trusted sources) and blacklists (for sources they don't want to see) to personalize their content feeds.

9. **Alternate Interfaces:** Encourage the development of alternate user interfaces by third-party developers. This way, even if the primary interface censors content, others can provide uncensored access.

10. **Legal Compliance:** Ensure that your platform complies with relevant legal regulations and is not used to facilitate illegal activities. Censorship may be required to comply with certain laws.

11. **Transparency and Appeals:** Make the moderation process transparent, and provide an appeals process for users who feel their content was unfairly censored.

12. **Blockchain Governance Proposals:** Allow for blockchain governance proposals related to censorship resistance. Community members can propose changes to the censorship policy through a democratic process.

The wise approach is to create a balance that respects freedom of speech while safeguarding the community from harmful content. Your community can decide what level of censorship resistance they are comfortable with by collectively shaping and maintaining the rules. Flexibility and community involvement are key to achieving a sensible and sustainable approach to censorship resistance within a decentralized ecosystem like LUKSO.

# One problem I can think of: A user has no funds in LYX token, but acts maliciously, however not in a way you would expell him from the platform. How to act?

Dealing with users who act maliciously but do not warrant expulsion from the platform due to their actions presents a challenge. In this situation, you can implement a set of measures to discourage malicious behavior and maintain a positive community environment:

1. **Warning System:** Implement a warning system that flags or notifies users about their malicious behavior. This can serve as an initial and less severe deterrent. Warnings can be displayed in a user's profile or messages.

2. **Temporary Restrictions:** Introduce temporary restrictions on users who engage in malicious behavior. For example, you can limit their ability to post, comment, or participate in certain community activities for a specified period.

3. **Loss of Reputation:** Create a reputation system that can be negatively impacted by malicious actions. Users with low reputation might be less influential or face additional restrictions.

4. **Community Voting or Reporting:** Allow the community to report malicious behavior and, in some cases, have the authority to vote on potential penalties. This adds a layer of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process.

5. **Social Proof Mechanisms:** Encourage users to build their social profiles and engage positively with the community. This might include highlighting users with a history of positive interactions and contributions.

6. **Appeals Process:** Establish an appeals process that allows users to explain and appeal the restrictions or warnings placed on them. This ensures that there's a mechanism for users to address potential misunderstandings or errors.

7. **Education and Guidelines:** Continuously educate users about community guidelines and norms. Misunderstandings can lead to malicious behavior, so providing clear guidance is essential.

8. **Track Record:** Maintain a record of user behavior and warnings. If a user consistently exhibits malicious behavior, the severity of penalties can increase gradually.

9. **Incentive Mechanisms:** Implement incentive mechanisms to encourage positive behavior. Users who engage constructively might receive rewards or recognition.

10. **User Reporting Tools:** Make it easy for users to report malicious behavior to moderators or the community. Quick response to reports can prevent escalating issues.

11. **AI and Content Analysis:** Use AI and content analysis tools to identify and flag malicious behavior, such as hate speech or harassment.

12. **Peer Mediation:** Encourage users to resolve disputes through mediation with the involvement of other community members. This can help address misunderstandings and conflicts.

13. **Blockchain Governance Proposals:** Allow the community to propose and vote on changes to the platform's approach to handling malicious behavior. This ensures that the rules reflect the will of the community.

The key is to have a layered approach that combines warnings, restrictions, reputation systems, and community involvement. The severity of measures can increase based on the frequency and seriousness of malicious behavior. It's important to strike a balance between addressing malicious actions and allowing users to learn from their mistakes and positively contribute to the community.

LSP3 Profile Metadata: This contract is suitable for adding information to user accounts, such as profile/cover images, external links, attributes, etc. It helps users customize their profiles within the community.

# reward or punish

LSP6 Key Manager: This contract allows for multi-control over accounts using different permissions. You can use it to manage ownership and control of tokens or assets in the tokenized community.

# The "micro social staking" for enabling reward or punish

LSP9 Vault: If you require a digital vault for users to store and transfer assets separately from their main accounts, this contract is useful for managing funds within the community.

# onboarding ease and promotion

LSP25 Execute Relay Call: This contract adds support for meta-transactions on your contracts, enabling gas-less transactions and simplifying the onboarding of new users. It's beneficial for lowering the barrier to entry for community members.

# When you collect all the data related to a group's creation, the choice of where to store this data depends on various factors, including whether you want to utilize a smart contract on the blockchain. Here are two common approaches:

Web2 (Centralized Database):

In a traditional web2 environment, you would typically save the group data in a centralized database. This can be a SQL database (e.g., MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB), depending on your specific requirements.
The group's metadata, such as its name, privacy settings, and members, would be stored in the database. You can use a backend server to handle data storage and retrieval.
Integration with the LUKSO Universal Profiles (UP) can still be achieved, as UPs can interact with traditional databases.
Web3 (Blockchain - Smart Contract):

If you want to take advantage of blockchain technology, you can create a smart contract to represent the group. This is a decentralized approach.
The group's data, including its name, privacy settings, and possibly member information, can be stored within the smart contract. Each group might have its own instance of the smart contract.
Members of the group and the public can interact with the group's smart contract on the blockchain.
This approach can be beneficial if you want to leverage blockchain for transparency, security, and decentralized control.
To integrate with LUKSO Universal Profiles (UP) or interact with other smart contracts, your group's smart contract would need to support the necessary interfaces and functionalities.
Choosing between web2 and web3 storage depends on factors like your project's level of decentralization, your desired level of control, and how you plan to integrate with other blockchain components. Using a smart contract to represent the group on the blockchain offers benefits in terms of transparency and decentralization but requires users to interact with the blockchain for group management. A centralized database may be simpler but is not as decentralized or transparent.

You can also consider a hybrid approach where critical data is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts, while less critical data that requires high scalability and flexibility is stored in a traditional database. This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of both web2 and web3 technologies.

# Data storage and handling:

We opt for a hybrid approach where critical data is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts, while less critical data that requires high scalability and flexibility is stored in a traditional database. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both web2 and web3 technologies.
